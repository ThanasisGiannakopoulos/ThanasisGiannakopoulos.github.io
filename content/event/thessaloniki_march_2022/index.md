abstract: The characteristic initial (boundary) value problem has numerous applications in general relativity (GR) involving numerical studies, and is often formulated using Bondi-like coordinates. Recently it was shown that several prototype formulations of this type are only weakly hyperbolic. I will discuss the root cause of this result, as well as its implications for the well-posedness of the associated PDE problems. If time permits, I will also discuss how weak-hyperbolicity can be realized in numerical experiments.

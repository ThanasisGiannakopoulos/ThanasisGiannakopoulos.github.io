I am a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, presently in
the [School of Physics & Astronomy][1] and previously in the [School
of Mathematical Sciences][2]. I am a member of the [Particle Cosmology
group][3] and the [Nottingham Center of Gravity][4].

My main research is numerical simulations of gravitational systems. It
combines theoretical knowledge of gravitation with numerical analysis,
software development, and data analysis. Recently, I have been
spending most of my time exploring numerical methods suitable for
theories beyond general relativity and developing a code for
gravitational collapse.  In the past, my work was focused on the
characteristic problem of general relativity, specifically its
mathematical properties of hyperbolicity and well-posedness, as well
as some of its applications.

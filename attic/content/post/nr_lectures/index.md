These are four lectures on Numerical Relativity given at the
Univeristy of Nottingham between November 2022 and January 2023. The
target group was PhD students of Physics and Mathematics, postdocs and
staff members. The goal was to paint a picture of what it is to do
Numerical Relativity and provide a few details on selected topics, but
not to train people as numerical relativists.

In lecture 4 there was more material presented, related to numerical
experiments with toy models. It can be found

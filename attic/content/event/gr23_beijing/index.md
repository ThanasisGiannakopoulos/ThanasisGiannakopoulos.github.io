title: Gauge structure of general relativity in Bondi-like coordinates

event: 23rd international conference on general relativity and gravitation
event_url: http://gravitation.web.ua.pt/index.php/node/4299

location: online

abstract: In the growing field of gravitational wave astronomy, the characteristic problem of general relativity (GR) can help provide waveform models with high accuracy. When combined with the standard Cauchy problem it can eliminate systematic extrapolation errors. GR in the characteristic setup is typically formulated in a Bondi-like gauge. Recently it was shown that several prototype formulations of this type are only weakly hyperbolic. I will discuss the root cause of this result and its implication for the Cauchy-Characteristic extraction and matching methods.
